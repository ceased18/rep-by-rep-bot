I’d like to integrate the USDA FoodData Central API into my bot so that I can fetch nutritional information (macros like Protein, Carbs, Fats, and Calories) for food items in the /mealplan command. Please do the following in my bot.py (or the relevant file):

Store the API Key Securely:
Ensure that my USDA API key is stored in Replit Secrets as USDA_API_KEY and retrieve it in the code using os.environ.get("USDA_API_KEY").
Install and Import Dependencies:
Make sure the requests library is installed (pip install requests) and import it at the top of the file.
Create a Helper Function:
Write a function called get_food_macros(food_name: str) -> dict that:
Sends an HTTP GET request to the USDA FoodData Central API’s search endpoint (e.g., https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/foods/search) using the API key and the food name as the query parameter.
Parses the JSON response to extract nutritional data—specifically the macros: Protein, Carbs, Fats, and Calories. If multiple results are returned, choose the best match (or simply the first result).
Returns a dictionary with keys like 'protein', 'carbs', 'fats', and 'calories' and their respective numeric values. If no data is found or an error occurs, return default placeholder values.
Integrate with the /mealplan Command:
In the code for /mealplan, for each food item in the meal plan, call get_food_macros(food_item_name) and include the fetched nutritional information (macros and calorie data) next to the food item in the PDF.
Logging and Error Handling:
Add console logging (e.g., print(f"Fetched macros for {food_name}: {result}")) to confirm the API call results.
Ensure that any exceptions (like connection errors or invalid responses) are caught gracefully so the bot does not crash.
Testing:
Test the helper function by fetching data for a sample food (e.g., "apple" or "chicken breast") and printing the result.
Then, run the /mealplan command in Discord and verify that the PDF includes the nutritional data for each food item.
Let me know if any errors occur in the console, or confirm once the USDA API integration is working correctly.
