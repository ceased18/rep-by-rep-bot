I need to integrate the Open Food Facts API into my Discord bot to fetch micronutrient information (like Iron, Calcium, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, etc.) for food items in the /mealplan command. I have little coding experience, so please do the following for me:

Store the API Key (if needed):

For Open Food Facts, an API key is not required. Just use their public endpoints.
Install and Import Dependencies:

Ensure that the requests library is installed (e.g., run pip install requests).
Import os and requests at the top of my botâ€™s main file.
Create a Helper Function:

Write a function named get_micronutrients(food_name: str) -> dict that does the following:
Sends an HTTP GET request to the Open Food Facts search endpoint (e.g., https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl) with parameters to search for the food name and return JSON data.
Parses the JSON response to extract micronutrient information such as Iron, Calcium, Vitamin A, and Vitamin C (using fields like iron_100g, calcium_100g, etc. from the response).
Returns a dictionary with keys for each micronutrient and their corresponding values. If no data is found, return placeholders like "Data not available."
Please include sample code comments to explain each step.

Integrate the Helper Function:

Modify the /mealplan command so that for each food item, it calls get_micronutrients(food_item) and includes the returned micronutrient information in the generated PDF.
Make sure that if the API call fails or no data is found, the PDF still displays placeholder values.
Testing and Logging:

Add console logging to confirm the API call for a food item (e.g., print out "Fetched micronutrients for [food_name]: [data]").
Test the helper function by fetching micronutrient data for a sample food (like "apple" or "chicken breast") and display the result in the console.
Final Verification:

Ensure that the /mealplan command now includes micronutrient information from the Open Food Facts API along with the existing macro data.
Please handle all the code changes and testing, and let me know if you run into any errors or if the integration is successful.
