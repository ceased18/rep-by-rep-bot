My /mealplan PDF output has several major formatting and calculation issues. Here’s what needs fixing:

Repeated “Total Daily Macronutrients”:
Right now, the PDF shows multiple “Total Daily Macronutrients” headers at the top.
I only want one such header (e.g., “Energy Summary” or “Total Daily Macros”) at the top, listing the overall daily protein, carbs, fats, and total calories.
Zeroed-Out Meal Totals:
Each meal section shows “Meal Totals: 0.0g, 0.0g, 0.0g,” etc., even though food items clearly have macros.
Make sure the code sums the item-level macros for each meal (protein, carbs, fats, and calories) and displays the correct totals, not zero.
Inconsistent Headings and Extra Headers:
Some items (like “8 oz chicken breast, cooked”) appear as a blue header instead of a normal line item.
Only the meal names (e.g., “Suhoor - 45 min before Fajr,” “Iftar - At Maghrib,” “Post-Taraweeh”) should be blue headers, not individual foods.
All other foods belong in the normal text lines below each meal header.
Wrong Macro Calculations:
The code is spitting out illogical macros (e.g., 224g protein for a 160-lb cutting goal, or repeated placeholders).
The instructions for cutting (400–1300 cal deficit) aren’t actually being applied.
Make sure the code uses the user’s stats (160 lbs, cutting, etc.) to produce a realistic daily calorie target and macros.
Apply the correct math so the total daily macros align with the meal-by-meal breakdown.
Double Meal Totals Sections:
After each meal, I see lines like “Meal Totals” repeated or leftover placeholders.
I only want one clear “Meal Totals” line at the end of each meal section, containing the sum of that meal’s items.
Energy Summary at the End or the Top:
Decide on one location (usually the top) for an “Energy Summary” that shows total daily macros (Protein, Carbs, Fats, Calories).
At the bottom, you can display “Highlighted Nutrients” or “Total Micronutrients.”
Make sure they are not repeated or zeroed out.
Micronutrients
The PDF sometimes shows “Iron: Data not available,” then “Iron: 15 mg” right after.
If we can’t fetch certain micronutrients from the API, show a single placeholder line (e.g., “Data not available”). If we do have data, show the numeric value once.
Ensure we don’t display contradictory or duplicate info.
Please clean up the code so that:

We have one clear daily macro summary (top of PDF).
Each meal is listed with a blue header for the meal name, item-level macros in normal text, and one correct “Meal Totals” line.
The daily macros and meal macros are calculated properly (especially for cutting).
The micronutrient data is shown once without duplicates.
Let me know if any console errors appear, and confirm once the PDF output is neat and consistent.
