I’m working on a Discord bot in a file called bot.py. My /mealplan command collects two sets of user inputs using await ctx.send and bot.wait_for, then generates a PDF using the reportlab library. The current PDF is plain and doesn’t look professional. I want to enhance it to match the clean, structured layout of my /rift_taps command (which has a title and blue section headers) and add specific features. Please update the /mealplan command in bot.py to apply the following changes:

1. Set the PDF name to "Meal Plan for [Name].pdf", where [Name] is the first input (e.g., "Meal Plan for Ishrak.pdf").
2. Structure the PDF with these sections, using the reportlab library:
   - Title: "Meal Plan for [Name]" at the top.
   - Section 1: "Total Daily Macronutrients" with a light blue background, displayed as a table with black borders (columns: "Nutrient" and "Amount", rows for Protein, Carbs, Fats).
   - Section 2: "Meals" with a light blue background for the header, listing meals (e.g., Iftar, Snack) with red bullet points for each meal’s items and macronutrients.
   - Section 3: "Total Micronutrients" with a light blue background, using red bullet points for each micronutrient.
   - Section 4: "Tips for Success" with a light blue background, including 3 red bullet points: "Stay hydrated during non-fasting hours.", "Prioritize protein at Suhoor and Iftar.", "Adjust portions based on energy levels."
   - Footer: "Feel free to ask questions about your meal plan!" in italic blue text.
3. Add a gradient background to the entire PDF, transitioning from light grey at the top to white at the bottom.
4. Add images: a "food_image.jpg" at the top (2 inches wide, 1 inch tall) and a "plate_icon.jpg" before each meal (0.5 inches wide, 0.5 inches tall). I’ve uploaded these images to my Replit project.
5. Ensure the meal plan data (macros, meals, micros) is based on the user inputs: First: "Ishrak, Male, 30, 160 lbs, 5'6, Cut, Halal, None", Second: "3 months, 10,000 steps, Active, None, Yes, 9am-5pm, 4 meals, 20%". Use placeholder data (e.g., Protein: 150g, Carbs: 200g, Fats: 60g) if the current logic doesn’t generate it yet.

Keep the input collection part (two await ctx.send and bot.wait_for steps) the same. Make sure the bot sends the PDF to Discord using await ctx.send(file=discord.File(pdf_name)). Check the console for errors (e.g., missing images, import issues) and let me know if there are any problems.
