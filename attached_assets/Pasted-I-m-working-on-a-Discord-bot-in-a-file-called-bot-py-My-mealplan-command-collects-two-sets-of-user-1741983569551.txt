I’m working on a Discord bot in a file called bot.py. My /mealplan command collects two sets of user inputs using await ctx.send and bot.wait_for, then generates a PDF using the reportlab library. I want to update the PDF to match the exact style of my /rift_taps command’s PDF output, which has a black title, a light grey subtitle background, darker blue section headers, a white background, and a clean layout with no bullet points. The current /mealplan PDF has light blue headers, a gradient background, and lines through the text, which I don’t want. Here’s what I want to change:

1. Set the PDF name to "Meal Plan for [Name].pdf", where [Name] is the first input (e.g., "Meal Plan for Ishrak.pdf").
2. Structure the PDF using the reportlab library to match the /rift_taps style exactly:
   - Title: "Meal Plan for [Name]" in black text, bold, with no background.
   - Subtitle: "Personalized Nutrition Plan for Ramadan" with a light grey background (same shade as the /rift_taps subtitle).
   - Background: Plain white, no gradient or lines (remove any gradient currently in the PDF).
   - Section 1: "Total Daily Macronutrients" with a darker blue background header (same shade as the /rift_taps section headers, not light blue), followed by a table with black borders (columns: "Nutrient" and "Amount", rows for Protein, Carbs, Fats).
   - Section 2: "Meals" with a darker blue background header, listing meals (e.g., Iftar, Snack) with subheadings for each meal in all caps (e.g., "IFTAR"). Under each meal, list the items and macronutrients in a clean, indented format like "Items: Dates: 3 pieces, Chicken breast: 4 oz | Protein: 45g, Carbs: 75g, Fats: 5g" with no bullet points.
   - Section 3: "Total Micronutrients" with a darker blue background header, listing micronutrients in a clean, indented format like "Vitamin A: 900 µg" with no bullet points.
   - Section 4: "Tips for Success" with a darker blue background header, listing 3 tips in a clean, indented format with no bullet points: "Stay hydrated during non-fasting hours.", "Prioritize protein at Suhoor and Iftar.", "Adjust portions based on energy levels."
   - Footer: "Feel free to ask questions about your meal plan!" in italic blue text.
3. Add images: a "food_image.jpg" below the subtitle (2 inches wide, 1 inch tall), and a "plate_icon.jpg" before each meal subheading (0.5 inches wide, 0.5 inches tall). I’ve uploaded these images to my Replit project.
4. Ensure the meal plan data (macros, meals, micros) is based on the user inputs: First: "Ishrak, Male, 30, 160 lbs, 5'6, Cut, Halal, None", Second: "3 months, 10,000 steps, Active, None, Yes, 9am-5pm, 4 meals, 20%". Use placeholder data (e.g., Protein: 150g, Carbs: 200g, Fats: 60g) if the current logic doesn’t generate it yet.

Keep the input collection part (two await ctx.send and bot.wait_for steps) the same. Remove any light blue headers, gradient background, or red bullet points currently in the PDF, and use the exact styling from the /rift_taps PDF (black title, light grey subtitle background, darker blue headers, white background, indented text with no bullets). Make sure the bot sends the PDF to Discord using await ctx.send(file=discord.File(pdf_name)). Check the console for errors (e.g., missing images, import issues) and let me know if there are any problems. Also, if there are lines through the text (possibly a Replit watermark), let me know how to remove them.
